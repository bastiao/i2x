        <p>Check configured data sources for changes in content from the previous integration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <ol>
            <li>Pool Content <em>STD-DataSource</em>: connect to external Data Source and load content

                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Data can be loaded from CSV, XML or JSON files, or from SQL or SPARQL query results (COEUS-like)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Return Content <em>DataSource-STD</em>: The Data Source returns with the requested content</li>

            <li>Check Changes <em>STD-ContentStore</em>: The STD imports the data into the internal Content Store and check if there have been any changes since the last update (the diff)

                <ul>
                    <li>External content is processes from the initial queries in a COEUS-like approach: XPath, JSONPath, SQL variables, column numbersâ€¦</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Return Diff <em>ContentStore-STD</em>: The ContentStore analyses the newly submitted content and returns a diff with the unique new content</li>

            <li>Push Diff <em>STD-FluxCapacitor</em>: If new content was actually found, it is sent to Flux Capacitor for processing

                <ul>
                    <li>The FluxCapactior can receive every and any format for further processing, meaning that it can be a service hook for external systems supporting this paradigm</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
